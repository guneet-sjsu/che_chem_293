What does the model achieve?
-The model depicts the linear regression between body weight and height. 

How should metrics be interpreted?
-the body weight increases as the height increases. With the postive slope of 5.130, it shows the weight is positively correlated with the height. 
The r square value of 0.87 depicts high variability of the data.


What are appropriate use cases?
-To predict weight based on the height among diverse populations. Assess if different factors such as diet, age or environment impact this analysis.

How is it implemented? *
-As the height is meaured between different humans, it can be predicted that the weight also increases. This data was collected from 10 individuals and plotted with Height as independent variable
and height was dependent variable. The linear regression was plotted in graphpad with positive slope. 

What are caveats/biases/concerns to its usage?
-this data is limited to only 10 samples, so the weight could still vary depending and regression could be questionable with limited data.

How to interpret this specific result and advising action/next steps
-the weight is increasing as the height increases, but it would be good to collect more data among different populations to assess if different environment, age, diet, ethnicity
plays a role in this analysis. This data targeted specific city and ethnic group.
